# palindromecheckernode

A palindrome checker with an Angular front-end and Node.
It evaluates your word/phrase and send a status code (200 if it is a palindrome, 400 if it is not) to the app.

To start it:

- Download all the files;
- Install NodeJS;
- Run "npm install" on the terminal to install the dependencies listed at package.json;
- Use the address "http://localhost:3000" to test it.

This is my first README, so sorry for any mistakes...
